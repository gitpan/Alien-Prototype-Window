Revision history for Perl extension Alien::Prototype::Window.

1.3.2   Tue Oct  2 11:46 PDT 2007
    - added POD coverage tests
    - now depends on Alien::scriptaculous, instead of using the version that
      came bundled with PWC.
    - fix dependency on Archive::Zip; its a -build- dependency, not a
      -configuration- dependency
    - added "passthrough" Makefile.PL; we -NEED- to have Module::Build
      installed, auto-generated compatibility Makefile.PLs are insufficient

1.3.1   Sun Sep 30 13:28 PDT 2007
    - added POD docs to Alien::Prototype::Window
    - added "--quiet" command line argument to "prototype-window-install".
    - changed versioning to "${PWC_version}.${alien_release}", so that releases
      could be issued out of sync with upstream PWC.

1.3     Tue Jul 17 20:56 PDT 2007
    - First public version.  Installs PWC 1.3
